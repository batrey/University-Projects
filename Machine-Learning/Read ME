This course  provided an introduction to machine learning methods and learning theory. Students will acquire a general background on machine learning and pattern recognition, including state-of-the-art techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning. The course will include five problem sets that are related to the course outline. Students will work individually or as part of teams to complete a term project that will pertain on the application of these methods in different scientific fields.  Topics will include:

Supervised learning
Regression
Generative learning
Naive Bayes
Bayesian learning
Discriminative learning
K-nearest neighbors
Decision trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kernels
Unsupervised learning
Clustering (K-means, hierarchical)
Dimensionality reduction methods (principal component analysis, independent component analysis)
Association rule mining
Self-organizing maps
Learning theory
Bias-variance trade-offs
Kernels
Statistical validation
VC Theory
ML applications in other fields (Social networks, biology, image processing)
Students will have to complete a computational/review project in coordination with the instructor.

Goals: Students will (1) Acquire fundamental knowledge of learning theory; (2) Learn how to design and evaluate supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms; and (3) Learn how to use machine learning methods for multivariate data analysis in various scientific fields.
